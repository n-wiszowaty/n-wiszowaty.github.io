									<p>Game Description:</p>
									<p>Sometime in the not too distant future, all of humanity and the animal kingdom has been abducted by aliens, all except for a goat who is deemed “too stupid” for their experiments. You play as Ramsey, a goat hell-bent on taking his revenge out on the aliens for not also abducting him. He is helped by Dr. Marvin, a monkey with the brain of a scientist who managed to escape the abduction by hiding in a refrigerator. Dr. Marvin augments Ramsey with weapons and upgrades as you find the necessary materials across the map. Ramsey’s goal is to eventually become abducted alongside everyone else.</p>

									<h2>Human Sacrafice for Dummies</h2>
									<p>Games Description:</p>
									<p>A novice necromancer with great ambitions sets out on a quest to sate his undying appetite for power and renown.
